# project planning for plasma dynamics in sputtering deposition

Create classes for Atom, Substrate, and RParticles (sputtering deposition simulation). 
Ensure that these classes contain necessary attributes and methods to handle the atom properties, substrate geometry, and plasma physics parameters.

# build plasma physics model

Build a plasma physics model that describes the energetics of the argon plasma 
This may include defining the plasma density, electron temperature, ion temperature, and other relevant plasma parameters. 
Use established models or equations from the literature to describe the behavior of the plasma.

# interaction between Plasma and Atoms

Implement the interaction between the argon plasma and the atoms on the substrate. Determine how the plasma particles (ions or neutrals) 
interact with the atoms and calculate the energy deposition on the substrate based on plasma parameters.


# particle motion
Simulate the motion of particles (atoms and ions) using a Monte Carlo method or other suitable approaches. 
Update the positions and velocities of the particles based on their interactions with the plasma and substrate.


# energy depositions and success
Calculate the energy deposition at each point on the substrate and determine whether each particle 
successfully attaches to the substrate based on the energy threshold.


# visualization
Create visualizers to plot the normalized total energy distribution, boolean success of particle deposition, 
and other relevant visualizations. Use matplotlib or other plotting libraries to generate plots and visualizations.


# parameter optimization
Set up parameter sweeps to investigate how different plasma parameters (e.g., plasma density, ion temperature) and atom properties 
(element, initial position...) affect the sputtering deposition process. 
Optimize the plasma and atom properties to achieve desired thin film deposition characteristics.

# correlation analysis
Perform correlation analysis between the plasma properties, atom properties, and the thin film deposition results.
Analyze the influence of different plasma and atom parameters on the thin film growth.

# simulation output

Save the simulation results and analysis data to appropriate file formats for further analysis and visualization. 
Also create functions to generate plots and visualize the data in different ways.

# validate with experimental data

Validate simulation results by comparing them with experimental data or results obtained from other well-established simulation models.

# more physics

Considering adding more complex physical models, such as incorporating more sophisticated plasma physics or additional 
particle-particle interactions to improve the accuracy and realism of the simulation.
