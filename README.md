# mahabadugelab
Repository for Dr. Mahabaduge's condensed matter research for Fall 2023


research intrests:

SCAPS-1D -> Solar Cell simulation software
Simulate Perovskites, Calchogenides, Kesterites, and other emerging thin film technologies

Plasma dynamics & characterization of excited argon gas to relate it's effect on sputtering deposition

Density functional theory (DFT) programming/simulation/analysis

Quantum materials simulation

Extracting data from magnetooptical curr effect

Plasma specroscopy -> montecarlo/computational modeling for the uv emissions

MURCE Student Research Circle / Learning Center python bootcamps


To do list:

change the random energy iterations into full montecarlo model for energy distributions. how might the plasma energetics effect distributions?

make an easy reliable way to extract the simulated data from SCAPS into python/julia dataframes and plotting visulaizers

build the sputtering depostion simulation, and integrate plasma characterization parameters

learn machine learning techniques to train solar cells / depostion models ?

train those intrested in python, how to use python libraries, install jupyter notebooks, handle different data structures

image processing for future cubesat mission

About the Deposition Model:
Project was started by joel in October 2022. Research presented at NCUR, GSU Perimeter Math Conference
Has potential to merge analysis with plasma characterization project
